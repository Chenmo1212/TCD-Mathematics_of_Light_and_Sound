# Math Grades

Hi professor Fergal,

Hope this email finds you well.

My name is Long Pan and my student id is 21332147. I am an AVR student in your lecture. I am writing to appeal the grade I received in my CS7GV2 module for the first semester. I feel as though I was graded unfairly and I would like to explain why. 

In the last semester, I insisted on attending every lecture, and I sat in the first row every time. In the first few weeks when the academic pressure is not heavy, I went on stage to demonstrate the results of my practice so many times. I have attempted to research each topic thoroughly and complete the exercises each week to the best of my ability. But this module only pays attention to the final exam grades. This kind of assessment method is really unreasonable and discourages students' enthusiasm.

What confuses me is that I have been reviewing every topic two weeks before the exam, and I have practiced many times for the exercises corresponding to the topic. 

The content of the exam is almost the same as the usual exercises.

During the exam, I tried my best to state my ideas clearly, and wrote corresponding notes for each part, and the generated pictures also tried my best to achieve legibility. For the five questions, the three highest scores of the three questions are taken, and I have already done each question in normal times. I was sure it met the requirements of the topic, but it did not achieve my ideal score. I would really appreciate it if you could tell me exactly where my demerits are.

I have a plan to apply for PhD, so any module did not achieve the expected grades will greatly hamper my chances of being admitted to college. I would very much like to meet with you at any time that is convenient for you to discuss the possibility of my grade being raised. I can be reached at Email Address. Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,

Long Pan



I have been working for a year. The reason why I went to graduate school again was because I wanted to settle myself more. Therefore, what I usually pay attention to is not only the content of the course, but also what I have learned. This time the results brought me not only the impact of the results, but also made me doubt whether the content I learned was correct.

I'm just a little unbelievable that my highest score for the five questions is only 70 points.



The purpose of doing this is to show that I want to study this course well



attending every lecture

sat the first row every time.

demonstrate the results of exercises so many times

show motivation of learning this module well

this assessment method only focused on the final exam grades

really unreasonable and discourage student's enthusiasm.

What confuses me is that I have been reviewing every topic two weeks before the exam.

Practice every topic so many times.

The questions of the exam are the same as the exercises.

try my best to explain my idea and comment the code, make the result image clear and readable.

just unbelievable that's the only result of choosing three of the five questions with the highest score.

have a plan to apply for Phd, unexpected grades will huge harmful my chances of being admitted to college.

Actually, I have been working for a year in 2021. The reason why I apply the cs master was because I wanted to learn more knowledge. So what I pay attention to is not only the content of the course, but also what I have learned. So I just hope I could know where I was being lost some grades. I would also be very grateful if my scores would be reconsidered as it would be of great help to my future PhD applications.
